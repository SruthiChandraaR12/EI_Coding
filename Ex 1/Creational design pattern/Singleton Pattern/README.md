# Singleton Pattern

## Overview
The *Singleton Pattern* ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Intent
- Guarantee a single instance throughout the application.
- Control access to shared resources.

## Use Case in This Project
This example demonstrates a *singleton database connection* where only one instance of the database object is created.

## Files
- SingletonDB.java → Implements singleton pattern for database object.
