# Adapter Pattern

## Overview
The *Adapter Pattern* allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another.

## Intent
- Bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
- Reuse existing classes without modifying their source code.

## Use Case in This Project
This example simulates a *social media app integration*, where the adapter allows different APIs to work together.

## Files
- SocialMediaApp.java → Demonstrates adapter logic for social media platforms.

## How to Run
```bash
javac SocialMediaApp.java
java SocialMediaApp
